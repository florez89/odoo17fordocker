# Building and Deploying Custom Docker Images for Odoo and PostgreSQL

This guide explains how to build custom Docker images for Odoo and PostgreSQL using their official repositories.  combining these images into a single application using Docker Compose.

## Objective
I create our own custom Docker images and integrate them into a single app, making it easy to manage both Odoo and PostgreSQL as one cohesive system.

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Official Repositories
- Start by using the official Odoo and PostgreSQL images from Docker Hub.

### 2. Build Custom Images
- Create your own Docker images based on the official ones.
- Add any necessary customizations (e.g., additional configurations or files).

### 3. Use Docker Compose
- Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the services for your app:
  - **Odoo service**: Uses your custom Odoo image.
  - **PostgreSQL service**: Uses your custom PostgreSQL image.
- Map ports so you can access Odoo on your browser and ensure PostgreSQL runs seamlessly.

### 4. Push Images to Docker Hub
- After building the images, push them to your Docker Hub repository for reuse and sharing.

### 5. Develop and Deploy
- Switch to the `develop` branch for ongoing updates and testing.
- Run the app using Docker Compose to verify everything works correctly.



## Note
- Replace `your-custom-odoo-image` and `your-custom-postgres-image` with the names of your built images.
- Ensure the `odoo_pass` file contains the database password and is securely managed.

This setup simplifies the process of managing Odoo and PostgreSQL in one application. Let us know if further clarification is needed!
